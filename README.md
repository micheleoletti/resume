# Mykhaylo Olefirenko's Resume

I am naturally a generalist and technology-agnostic, I just want to build stuff that's useful to other humans.

Currently freelancing for a couple of companies:
- food supply management startup, focusing on refactoring/dockerizing backend services and fully rewriting the frontend in React/Next.js with Jest and Playwright testing
- ML/AI startup, supporting and refactoring their machine learning pipelines and the web app(currently we're rewriting it from scratch)

On the side I'm working on Jam, an app for musicians:

I'm also publishing some Javascript related content here from time to time:
