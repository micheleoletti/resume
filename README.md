# Mykhaylo Olefirenko's Resume

Currently freelancing, working with an Italian startup and focusing on refactoring/dockerizing backend services and fully rewriting the frontend in React/Next.js with Jest and Playwright.

On the side I'm also working on Jam, an app for musicians:

I am naturally a generalist and technology-agnostic, I just want to build stuff that's useful to other humans.
